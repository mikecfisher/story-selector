        3 to 5 questions that will help the user write about themselves. Again The Topics and Locations may not directly relate to each other.
        Example: Just because someone wants to talk about college and they have lived in NYC doesn't mean they went to college in NYC

        Please keep the length of the questions to no more than 500 characters.
